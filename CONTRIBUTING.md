## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug, we’ll really appreciate it if you [open an issue](https://github.com/chloi/grunt-surge/issues) with as many details as possible. The easier you make it for us to recreate the issue we found, the faster we can move onto trying to fix it.

If you taking the time to mention a problem, even a seemingly minor one, it is greatly appreciated, and a totally valid contribution to this project. Thank you!
